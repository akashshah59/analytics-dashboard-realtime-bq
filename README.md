<h3> The project was an ambitious attempt at building Automated KPI visualizations where we're able to enter the KPI we want in form of dropdowns 
and an automated query was generated that would build a query in the background and choose an appropriate visualization for the same. <h3>

This repository contains pure python code that uses Dash , Plotly and Google APIs to create an analytical dashboard for data hosted in Google Big Query.
